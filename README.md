hMixer
======

hMixer is a tool for healthcare professionals and organizations to define their version of [hGraph](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph).

hMixer was created as a feedback tool for:
- Defining the [hScore](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hScore) algorithm
- Defining key metrics to display on the [hGraph](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph)
- Defining healthy ranges for health metrics to provide a default for [hGraph](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph)

The results of submissions could be viewed as a crowdsourced way to define a default hGraph and hScore for humans.
